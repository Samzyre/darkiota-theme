# Darkiota

### **What is this?**

It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes.
A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.

If you give it a go, please consider letting me know what you think. 
Thoughts for improvements, changes or new ideas, all feedback is welcome!


### **Syntax Support**
So far, Rust has been my main canvas to paint with colors, but might add specific color tunes for other languages too as the time goes on.
Although, on a general level it should be okay with any language, intended look might seems a bit off with some.


### **Some notes**
- It's just one theme right now, maybe I'll add some variants to this at some point.. :)
- The icon theme I use is [material-icon-theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)
