# Darkiota

### **What is this?**

It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes.
A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.

If you give it a go, please consider letting me know what you think. 
Thoughts for improvements, changes or new ideas, all feedback is welcome!


**Version 2.0** is here and brings two new theme variations focused on syntax. While the variants
don't change the surrounding editor look, their token colors have been totally revamped along with
some changes of their own. Their aim is to make the theme look more consistent and hopefully more
readable across different languages and highlights.


**Syntax support** goal is to keep token highlights as general as possible. In some cases however,
the feel might seem a bit off and needs tuning.


### **Some notes**
- Version 1.x theme is now renamed to `Darkiota Origin`
- The two new variations are called `Space` and `Space Altered`
- The icon theme I use is [material-icon-theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)
