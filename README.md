# Darkiota

### **What is this?**
It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes. Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.


### **Syntax Support**
Right now the focus has been on Rust, but might add syntax tunes for other languages as the time goes on.


### **Notes**
It's just one theme right now, maybe I'll add some variants to this at some point.. :)
