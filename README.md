# Darkiota

### **What is this?**
It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes. A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it. Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.


### **Syntax Support**
Right now the focus has been on Rust, but might add syntax tunes for other languages as the time goes on.


### **Notes**
- It's just one theme right now, maybe I'll add some variants to this at some point.. :)
- The icon theme I use is [material-icon-theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)
