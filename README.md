# Darkiota

### **What is this?**

It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning and tweaking a bit by bit.
A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
Perhaps it's getting somewhere, becoming something.

If you give it a go, please consider letting me know what you think. All feedback is welcome! :)

**Version 2.6** currently features three theme variants that all share the same
surrounding workbench look and some syntactical styles.<br>
(Differences may vary depending on language)

### **Some notes**

- Attempting to keep **syntax support** as generic as possible.
- **Semantic highlighting** colors may or may not be consistent.
- The icon theme I use is [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
