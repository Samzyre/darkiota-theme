# Darkiota

### **What is this?**

It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes.
A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.

If you give it a go, please consider letting me know what you think. 
In case you have thoughts for improvements, changes or new ideas, everything is welcome!


### **Syntax Support**
Right now the focus has been on fitting the colors for Rust highlights, but might add syntax tunes for other languages too as the time goes on.


### **Notes**
- It's just one theme right now, maybe I'll add some variants to this at some point.. :)
- The icon theme I use is [material-icon-theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)
