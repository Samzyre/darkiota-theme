### **What is this?**

It's a vscode color theme that I have been tuning a bit by bit to fit my likes.
A theme that combines ideas and thoughts into something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
Nothing is perfect but I think it's getting somewhere.

If you give it a go, please consider letting me know what you think. All feedback is welcome! :)

**Version 2.1** currently features three theme variants (although subtle.. depending),
which all share the same surrounding workbench look. Compared to `v2.0`, some workbench colors have been
adjusted, including terminal, settings menu, and other details from new vscode updates.
A few token colors have been shifted around and/or tweaked with a couple of additions. 

### **Some notes**

- Attempting to keep **syntax support** as generic as possible. Inevitably,
  some specific items or a language highlight might need a bit of tuning sometimes.
- The icon theme I use is [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
